Hope Music Player UI. This frontend component is made using React.js. Hope is a music player that lets you play YouTube videos as streaming audio. Hope Player is always free, and is open-sourced. I do not earn any royalty from it, but donations are welcome!

# Why Hope?
I had shelved this project for many months until I found the skills to make it a reality, but more importantly I found a reason to finally build it, and that reason brings a lot of hope in my life! I sometimes tend to name things based on the things around me (less effort to think about it), so it is also partly inspired by the Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope poster on my wall.

# Disclaimer
The code that this UI component depends on involves performing YouTube data parsing using Youtube-dl. The motive of the tool is purely non-commercial and for educational purposes. The person using the repository must understand that YouTube data is propreitary and usage of this tool on copyrighted videos may invite legal actions. I am therefore not liable for any damages you incur. With great power comes great responsibility - use it wisely. I myself do not hold any copyright or ownership of any videos parsed using this tool.
